#444ms, original solution. I don't know why I use a JOIN ...
SELECT DISTINCT a.customer_number
FROM orders AS a
INNER JOIN (SELECT customer_number, COUNT(*) AS num
            FROM orders
            GROUP BY customer_number
            ORDER BY num DESC
            LIMIT 1) AS temp
USING(customer_number);


#434ms, official solution
SELECT customer_number
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_number
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1;
