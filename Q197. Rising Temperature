#DATEDIFF: calculate difference between DATEs, better not to use +/-
#use WHERE or JOIN to complete a self join

#610ms, original code
SELECT w1.Id
FROM weather AS w1, weather AS w2
WHERE DATEDIFF(w1.RecordDate, w2.RecordDate) = 1
AND w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature;

#479ms, official answer
SELECT w1.Id
FROM weather AS w1
INNER JOIN weather AS w2
ON DATEDIFF(w1.RecordDate, w2.RecordDate) = 1
WHERE w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature;
